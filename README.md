## General info

The purpose was to learn how to use Puppeteerjs and use it to scrape various pages. 
For this project it is used for scrapping bestseller books from bookdepository.com and amazong.com.
The main struggle was to make it work for more than one page per site.

## Technologies
* Nodejs version: 14.6.0
* Puppeteer version: 5.2.1

## Notes

In order to avoid extra execution time the code for bookdepository is on comments so won't run for both everytime.
